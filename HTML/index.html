        <h1>Chicken</h1>
        <section><b>The chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from
            the red junglefowl, originally from Southeast Asia. They have also partially
            hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
            junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1]called a cockerel. <span style="background-color: aqua;">A male
            </span>that has been castrated is a capon.
            An
            adult female
            bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
            Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat
            and eggs) or as pets.</section>

        <p>

        <h4>Traditionally</h4>, they were also bred for cockfighting,
        which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are
        broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.
