    <p>Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures
        change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core
        temperature.[1][2] Fish can acoustically<span> communicate</span> with each other, most often in the context of
        feeding,
        aggression or courtship.[3]</p>

    <p>Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high
        mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g.,
        cusk-eels and snailfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean.[4] With
        34,300 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.[5]</p>
